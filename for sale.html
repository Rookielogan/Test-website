        <p>NOTE that for every purchase you make a 2 year warranty is rewarded,meaning if the purchased product is damaged within two years you can get it fixed or replaced at no extra cost.Awesome right? Just go to any electronics store in yor area and present the receipt of of your purchase for confirmation and you're good to go. But note that third party damages are not covered by this warranty and that this warranty is valid for two years alone any item brought in after with proof of payment is invalid.  </p>
